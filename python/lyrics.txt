We go all or nothing
All or nothing
Why not make it count for something?

All or nothing
All or nothing
Fight for something we believe in

If we never stop hoping
We will never be broken
Even if our heart aches

We go all or nothing
All or nothing
Why not make it count for something?

When the city lights are calling at night
And you lay in bed rethinking your life
Will it ever stop the worrying mind
You will find

If we're running away from the problems we see
Keep giving up on our hopes and our dreams
We got the power to be who we want to be
You see

We go all or nothing
All or nothing
Why not make it count for something?

All or nothing
All or nothing
Fight for something we believe in

If we never stop hoping
We will never be broken
Even if our heart aches

We go all or nothing
All or nothing
Why not make it count for something?

We go all or nothing
All or nothing
Why not make it count for something?

All or nothing
All or nothing
Fight for something we believe in
